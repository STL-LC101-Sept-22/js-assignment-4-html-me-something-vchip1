<b>I was born and raised in the St. Louis suburb of Kirkwood and currently live in nearby Brentwood.<br>
I attended Kirkwood High School where I participated in swimming and water polo. I was also very active in music<br>
and played in several local bands as well as the Kirkwood High School Jazz Ensemble. I renturned to the area<br>
recently after being mostly away for almost 12 years and am happy to be closer to my parents and<br>
extended family.  I'm also very happy that St. Louis has a thriving TV/Film industry that I can work in while<br>
I'm here.</b>

   I went to college at the University of Missouri (then the University of Missouri-Columbia) where I majored in<br>
   English Literature with a minor in German Studies. I got an amazing education at Mizzou that I am extremely grateful<br>
   to have.  I also enjoyed the local music scene and the food!

      After college I participated in the AmeriCorps VISTA program, which is a year-long volunteer assignment. I was<br>
      sent to the Kansas City area where I helped a local community organization promote gardening and establish a farmers'<br>
      market. I enjoyed going to the late night Jazz Jams at the Mutual Musician's foundation and getting to know people<br>
      in the area.

         After my AmeriCorps term was up, I decided to move to the East coast. New York was one of my favorite places<br>
         to visit, so I settled there. I enjoyed living in various parts of Brooklyn and Manhattan for many years. My favorite<br>
         neighborhood is Sunset Park and I hope to live there again one day. The people are so friendly and I loved the local<br>
         Puerto Rican Day Parade they had down 5th Ave. New York is also where I met my lovely wife and where I began working in<br> 
         the film industry as a PA, later moving on to grip and electric work and finally rental house/service which I continue to do today.<br>

            In 2018 my then-girlfriend had been wanting to move back to her hometown of Newport, RI, and I was happy to follow her<br>
            and try life outside the city again. Rhode Island is such a beautiful state and I enjoyed snorkeling around Brenton Point State Park<br> 
            and the summers on the beach. I also met some of my best friends there and began taking photography more seriously.
